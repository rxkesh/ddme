Welcome to the Fraternity Pledge Rides mobile application! This app is designed to streamline the process of organizing and providing rides within a fraternity at Virginia Tech. Whether you're a pledge offering rides or a fellow fraternity member in need of transportation, this app makes the process easier and more convenient. Built using Swift and SwiftUI, it focuses on elegance and ease-of-use.
Features

    Pledge Rides: Pledges can offer rides to other fraternity members with just a few taps. It simplifies what used to be a complicated process, making it more efficient for everyone.
